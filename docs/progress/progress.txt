- Date: 2026-02-13
- Owner: codex
- Branch: master
- Done:
  - Added long-running harness baseline files:
    - docs/HARNESS.md
    - scripts/session_bootstrap.sh
    - docs/issue_contract.json
    - docs/progress/progress.txt
  - Initialized issue contract entries for Scholar intelligence refactor and harness baseline.
- Validation:
  - chmod +x scripts/session_bootstrap.sh
  - scripts/session_bootstrap.sh runs and prints repository/session context
- Risks/Notes:
  - issue_contract.json is intentionally minimal and should be updated incrementally, not rewritten.
- Next:
  - Complete SCHOLAR-P0 and SCHOLAR-P1 implementation and mark status updates.

- Date: 2026-02-13
- Owner: codex
- Branch: master
- Done:
  - Refactored Scholars list into a watchlist console focused on decisions and actions.
  - Added decision metrics per scholar card: Momentum, Track Match, New Since Last Seen, Risk/Noise.
  - Added action controls: Add to Watchlist, Mute (selected), Create Track from Scholar.
  - Added local mute/last-seen persistence for operator workflow continuity.
  - Upgraded Scholar detail page to an evidence-driven cockpit with decision cards and evidence links in Signals/Network sections.
  - Strengthened cross-module action links to Research, Workflows, Dashboard, Papers.
- Validation:
  - ./node_modules/.bin/eslint src/components/scholars/ScholarsWatchlist.tsx src/app/scholars/[id]/page.tsx
  - ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit
  - python -m py_compile src/paperbot/api/routes/research.py
  - ./scripts/session_bootstrap.sh
- Risks/Notes:
  - "Mute" and "Last Seen" are currently local user-browser state (localStorage), not server-synced preferences.
  - "Create Track from Scholar" currently creates a track and routes into Research; no duplicate-name reconciliation beyond backend response.
- Next:
  - If needed, move mute/seen state to backend user preferences and add team-shared watchlist controls.
